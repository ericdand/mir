Music Information Retrieval

This repository contains project code for CSC 475: Music Information Retrieval.

# Setup
This project uses [Marsyas](http://marsyas.info/), and its Python bindings. You may or may not need to build Marsyas from source to get the bindings working. A how-to on building and installing Marsyas for use in this project will be added soon.
